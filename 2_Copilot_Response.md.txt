Creating a **CPD Tracker Android app** using **Python** and **Visual Studio Code (VSC)** is a great idea, and it's definitely achievable using **Kivy** or **BeeWare** for the UI, **SQLite** for local storage, and **Google Drive API** for cloud backup.

Here’s a **step-by-step breakdown** of what we’ll do:

---

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries Needed

1. **Python 3.10+**
2. **Kivy** – for building the Android UI
3. **Buildozer** – to compile the app for Android
4. **SQLite** – for local database
5. **Google Drive API** – for cloud backup
6. **Pillow** – for image handling
7. **Zipfile** – for backup zipping
8. **Cron or Scheduled Task** – for biweekly backup (handled in app logic)

---

## 📁 App Features

- Add CPD entry with:
  - Current date
  - Start and end date
  - Name
  - Type (dropdown)
  - Description
  - Photo (camera or gallery)
- Save to local SQLite DB
- Backup every 2 weeks to Google Drive (zipped with photos)
- Professional UI using KivyMD

## ✅ Let's Start: Step-by-Step Code Generation

Would you like me to:

1. **Generate the full code base** (starting with `main.py`, `cpd.kv`, and `database.py`)?
2. **Create a zipped folder with all files** ready to open in VSC?
3. **Include instructions for setting up Buildozer and deploying to Android?**

Let me know how you'd like to proceed — I can generate the code and package it for you, or walk you through each part interactively.
