# CPD Tracker - OCR Feature Implementation

## Overview
The CPD Tracker app now includes OCR (Optical Character Recognition) functionality that allows users to extract text from captured photos and use it to automatically populate the description field.

## How OCR Works in the App

### 1. Photo Capture with OCR Processing
- When a user captures a photo, the app automatically processes it for text extraction
- If OCR is available, the captured image is analyzed using Tesseract OCR engine
- The app extracts readable text from the image

### 2. Text Selection Interface
- After text extraction, a dialog appears showing the extracted text
- Users can:
  - View all extracted text in a scrollable text field
  - Edit or modify the extracted text
  - Select portions of text they want to use
  - Choose to use the text or skip OCR

### 3. Description Auto-Population
- Selected OCR text is automatically added to the description field
- If the description field already has content, OCR text is appended
- Users get immediate feedback confirming the text was added

## Technical Implementation

### Dependencies
- **pytesseract**: Python wrapper for Tesseract OCR engine
- **Pillow (PIL)**: Image processing library
- **Tesseract OCR engine**: Core OCR functionality (needs separate installation)

### Key Features
1. **Automatic Text Detection**: Extracts text from captured photos
2. **User-Friendly Interface**: Clean dialog for text selection and editing
3. **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback when OCR is not available
4. **Cross-Platform**: Works on Android and desktop environments

### OCR Process Flow
```
1. User captures photo
2. Photo saved to device storage
3. OCR processing begins (if available)
4. Text extraction using Tesseract
5. Text selection dialog appears
6. User edits/selects desired text
7. Selected text added to description field
8. Photo synced to Google Drive
```

## Installation Requirements

### For Development (Windows)
1. Install Python packages:
   ```
   pip install pytesseract pillow
   ```

2. Install Tesseract OCR engine:
   - Download from: https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki
   - Install the executable
   - Add to PATH environment variable

### For Android Deployment
- Tesseract OCR will be bundled with the APK automatically
- No additional installation required for end users

## Usage Instructions

1. **Start Photo Capture**: Tap the camera button to open camera view
2. **Take Photo**: Tap capture button to take a picture
3. **OCR Processing**: App automatically processes the image for text
4. **Text Selection**: Dialog appears with extracted text
5. **Edit Text**: Modify the extracted text as needed
6. **Use Text**: Tap "Use This Text" to add to description
7. **Alternative**: Tap "Skip" to proceed without using OCR text

## Error Handling

The app handles various OCR scenarios:

- **OCR Not Available**: Shows informative message with installation instructions
- **No Text Found**: Notifies user that no readable text was detected
- **Processing Errors**: Displays helpful error messages
- **Tesseract Missing**: Provides specific installation guidance

## Benefits for CPD Tracking

1. **Efficiency**: Quickly extract certificate details from photos
2. **Accuracy**: Reduce manual typing errors
3. **Completeness**: Capture all relevant information from documents
4. **Time-Saving**: Automatic population of description fields
5. **Professional**: Extract course names, dates, and CPD points automatically

## Example Use Cases

- **Training Certificates**: Extract course names, dates, and CPD points
- **Conference Badges**: Capture event names and participation details
- **Workshop Materials**: Extract key learning outcomes
- **Professional Documents**: Capture relevant professional development information

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for OCR functionality:
- Advanced text formatting recognition
- Automatic field mapping (dates, points, etc.)
- Multiple language support
- Improved text cleaning and processing
- Integration with common CPD certificate formats
